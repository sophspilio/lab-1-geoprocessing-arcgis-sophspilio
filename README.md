# LAB 1: GEOPROCESSING IN ARCGIS
Due: 23 OCT 2020

This lab explores using Python within ArcMap. The first script `file.flooding.py`, was created by exporting a model created within the ModelBuilder tool. This script has three parts. It begins by defining the inputs. `floodzones.shp` and `basin.shp` are the two input variables that will be clipped. A temporary variable,  `flood_Clip.shp` is created, and then is used to select the floodzones that are identified as Special Flood Hazard Areas. 
The second script created during this lab was `my_clip.py`. This script was created in a code editor outside of ArcMap using the `arcpy` module. THis script defined a workspace enviornment, and then ran a clip analysis. Although the script was written outside of ArcMap, the `arcpy` tool allows you to run it and the results will still work within Arc (as long as file names are mapped correctly). This script clipped the `lakes.shp` file using to the extent of `basin.shp`, which ulitimately created a new clipped `lake_myClip.shp`. 
### Errors? 
I came across a few issues while trying to finish the `my_clip.py` in Part 3. I used the `file.flooding.py` script as a reference, because I knew that this script had successfully run using `arcpy`. I ended up defining local variables, and after playing around with syntax and file names (using `\\` instead of `\`), I was able to successfully run this script in the Python IDLE and have my result show up in the correct folder in ArcMap.
